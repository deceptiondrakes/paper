\noindent Congratulations on having a paper selected for inclusion in an AAAI Press proceedings or technical report! This document details the requirements necessary to get your accepted paper published using \LaTeX{}. If you are using Microsoft Word, instructions are provided in a different document. If you want to use some other formatting software, you must obtain permission from AAAI Press first. 

The instructions herein are provided as a general guide for experienced \LaTeX{} users who would like to use that software to format their paper for an AAAI Press publication or report. If you are not an experienced \LaTeX{} user, do not use it to format your paper. AAAI cannot provide you with support and the accompanying style files are \textbf{not} guaranteed to work. If the results you obtain are not in accordance with the specifications you received, you must correct your source file to achieve the correct result. 

These instructions are generic. Consequently, they do not include specific dates, page charges, and so forth. Please consult your specific written conference instructions for details regarding your submission. Please review the entire document for specific instructions that might apply to your particular situation. All authors must comply with the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item You must use the latest AAAI Press \LaTeX{} macro.
\item Download the author kit.
\item Complete, sign, and return by the deadline the AAAI copyright form (proceedings authors) or distribution license (technical report authors).
\item Read and format your paper source and PDF according to the formatting instructions for authors.
\item Submit your electronic files and abstract using our electronic submission form \textbf{on time.}
\item Submit your copyright form, and any required page or formatting charges to AAAI Press so that they are received by the deadline.
\item Check every page of your paper before submitting it.
\end{itemize}
